Rackspace Cloud Monitoring can be used with Rackspace servers and non-Rackspace servers. When you are using a Rackspace server, you can be at a Managed Operations service level or a Managed Infrastructure service level. There are some differences between what you can do in any one of these circumstances. This page describes each circumstance.

- [Rackspace servers with a Managed Operations service level](#managed-operations)
- [Rackspace servers with a Managed Infrastructure service level](#managed-infra)
- [Unmanaged non-Rackspace servers](#unmanaged)

**Note:** No non-Rackspace servers are managed.

## Rackspace servers with a Managed Operations service level

- Entities for Rackspace servers and databases are managed automatically, which means:
  - Monitoring entities are created automatically for new cloud servers or new cloud databases.
  - When a cloud server or cloud database is deleted, the associated entity is deleted in the monitoring system.
  - When the cloud server name is changed, the name is changed in monitoring automatically. (You cannot change the instance name for cloud database)


- The label for Rackspace Cloud Servers can be changed only on the server directly. The change  propagates to the monitoring system quickly. The instance name for a cloud database cannot be changed.

- These servers have the default notification plan **npTechnicalContactsEmail** and have an additional notification entry, **npManaged**.

- The agent needs the agent token to authenticate with the monitoring server. This value is stored as **monitoring_token** in the agent configuration file. The agent is able to identify the server it is installed on to the server.

- By default, the monitoring agent is installed and turned on, and the monitoring is configured automatically. For details, see [Managed accounts hosting](https://www.rackspace.com/dedicated-servers).

- For Cloud Databases customers, the monitoring agent is installed with monitoring configured automatically, by default. For details, see the [Cloud Databases documentation](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-databases/v1/developer-guide/).

- You can access some monitoring features through the Cloud Control Panel and all the features through API. You can see more monitoring features, as well as metrics, through the [Cloud Intelligence interface](https://intelligence.rackspace.com/).

<a name="unmanaged"></a>
## Unmanaged non-Rackspace servers

- Entities for non-Rackspace servers and databases must be managed manually, this means:
  - Monitoring entities need to be created manually for new servers . When configuring the default monitoring agent, you either select an entity you already created for it,or let the setup process create one for you.
  - When a server is deleted, you must delete the associated monitoring entity through the API or CLI.
  - When the server name is changed, you must manually change the name in monitoring.


- Monitoring entities can be deleted, and the label for servers can be changed.

- These servers have the default notification plan **npTechnicalContactsEmail** only.

- The agent needs the agent token to authenticate with the monitoring server. This value is stored as **monitoring_token** in the agent configuration file.

  In addition, the agent needs to know the entity on which it is installed. This value is the **agent_id** associated with the entity on the monitoring server. This is also a field in the agent configuration file.

  If you are going to create an image from a non-Rackspace server to be used to create more servers, you need to remove the **agent_id field**, *before you generate the image*, in the agent configuration file that is generated when you run the agent setup. Otherwise, the agent will be associated with the entity from which the image was created and the checks won't work properly.

  Agent configuration file are located at the following paths:
  - Ubuntu, CentOS: **/etc/rackspace-monitoring-agent.cfg**
  - Windows: **c:\ProgramData\Rackspace Monitoring\config\rackspace-monitoring-agent.cfg**

  To learn more about agent configuration, see [Install and configure the Rackspace Monitoring Agent](/how-to/install-and-configure-the-rackspace-monitoring-agent).

- By default, the monitoring agent must be manually installed. For details, see the [Cloud Monitoring documentation](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#install-and-configure-the-agent).

- You can see monitoring features, as well as metrics, through the [Cloud Intelligence interface](https://intelligence.rackspace.com/).
